## Introduction

For this project, I went with ReactJS and Redux, as it seems like the best solution for the task at hand.

* `Create-React-App` was chosen so I wouldn't have to worry too much about configuration.
* `Redux-Persist` is used to persist and store highscores in localStorage.
* `Lodash` is used to sort the highscores, as well as limit the results to the top 10 scores.
* `Material-UI` was added later in the project to save some time on creating basic components.

I have to admit, it's not my best or cleanest code, I was stressed out during the development of this, but it does get the job done.

## Installation

_NOTE:_ You may need to have **CRA** installed globally.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```

```bash
yarn
or
npm install
```

## Running the project

```bash
yarn start
or
npm run start
```
Now visit `localhost:3000` if it doesn't open automatically.
